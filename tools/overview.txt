File: Overview

(see DPSO_Logo.png)

DPSO Fundamentals is a complete mission makers tool, used to create complex missions with ease.
Using the huge Library of functions, settings and modules you can create almost any type of mission.
DPSO Fundamentals is designed to be entirely modular, meaning you can use as much or as little as you want.
By default, the master switches are set to off so only what you want to use will be used.
DPSO Fundamentals has been used by the DPSO in one form or another for nearly 3 years.
At the turn of 2019 we decided to publish our work and make all our files open source.
That means you're free to download, edit, change and create your own work, based on what we've already made.

This mod is the DPSO's one stop shop for all functionality to complement any mission.
We use it extensively with <@ACE at https://http://ace3mod.com> and <@TFAR at http://radio.task-force.ru/en/> and this is where it works best, however you only need <@CBA at https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=450814997> to use this mod.
